# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting heart disease based on patient health parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Interactive visualizations for better understanding

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains patient medical records with labeled heart disease outcomes. It is preprocessed to ensure clean and relevant features for prediction.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model.

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy in predicting heart disease, making it a valuable tool for early diagnosis.
